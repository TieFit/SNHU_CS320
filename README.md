1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  I can ensure my program is functional and secure by planning how to write my program before starting and also through regular checks during development to ensure everything works as intended. For example, when I finish writing a function I will normally utilize print
  statements or a similar measure to ensure that it is functioning as intended before moving onto the next.  

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  When writing a program I structure it around the requirements first and foremost. The purpose of a program is for it to accomplish a specific task in a particular way while adhering to various requirements. Ignoring user needs will only cause you to write redundant
  code that will need to be redone. As such, I do my best to ensure the program being written strictly adheres to the requirements. 

3. How do I approach designing software?
   I design software by focusing what it is the code is accomplishing. When writing code I like to dedicate each file to a specific function of the software. For example, if I were to have a contact object, I would dedicate a file to that object and its immediate features
   such as getters and setters.
